I always forgot how to do some stuff, so saving here for my reminder...

How to test npm package locally before publishing to npm

Navigate to your package directory:
cd /path/to/your/package
Run npm link to create a global symlink:

npm link
Navigate to your project where you want to test the package:

cd /path/to/your/project
Run npm link your-package-name:

npm link your-package-name

Replace your-package-name with the name of your package as specified in the package.json.
